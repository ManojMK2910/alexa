        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Amazon Alexa, also known simply as Alexa , is a virtual assistant AI technology developed by Amazon,
            first used in the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Echo Dot, Echo Studio and Amazon Tap speakers developed
            by Amazon Lab126.It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms,
            streaming
            podcasts, playing
            audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news.Alexa can
            also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation system. Users
            are able to extend the Alexa capabilities by installing "skills" (additional functionality developed by
            third-party vendors, in other settings more commonly called apps) such
            as weather programs and audio features.</p>

                    list

        <div class="ad">
            <div>
                <h1 class="mis">Mishearing</h1>
                <p>Alexa has sometimes trouble to hear your voice, which means it tries to substitute something else
                    when it doesn’t have
                    the correct information.
                    So if you can’t get what you are looking for, it will frustrate you.

                <h1>Slow response and Bloatware</h1>
                <p>Many users have reported missing features after the recent updates. The Alexa app became excessively
                    slow in responding.
                    Some other users have lately blamed the updated version of Amazon Alexa. It used to work fine on
                    Android 9 and older but
                    seems glitch. One day, the app works fine .
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Connection Drops</h1>
                <p>“I’m Sorry, I lost connection with your phone.” is the message you get in response to your query
                    often.
                    The problem can be frustrating when you have multiple devices to use with a single WiFi network at
                    home.</p>
